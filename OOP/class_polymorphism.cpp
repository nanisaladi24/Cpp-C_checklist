/*
Problem:
- Understand constructors and destructors of class and how they subclasses inherit them
- Understand 'final' keyword which doesn't allow subclasses to override methods
- understand purpose of 'virtual' keyword
- understand overload and overriding
- struct (also supports functions) vs class. struct cannot support concepts like functional classes(forgot term, but I meant these classes are used to encapsulate a class of functions and variables
but no object is actually created with this class(mostly static definitions)),inheritance
